        we find the sub-matching of the maximum matching we found in stage 1 that is composed only of "good" nodes.<br>
        The maximum matching from stage 1 is drawn in <span style="color: {{matching_color}}">{{matching_color}}</span>.<br>
        The "Good" nodes from stage 2 are drawn in <span style="color: {{good_color}}">{{good_color}}</span>.<br>
        The "Bad" nodes from stage 2 are drawn in <span style="color: {{bad_color}}">{{bad_color}}</span>.<br><br>
        The sub-matching returned from the algorithm is drawn in <span style="color: {{good_color}}">{{good_color}}</span>.<br>
        The article asserts this sub-matching is envy-free.

<h3>
    General explanation:
</h3>
<h4>
    Envy free bipartite matchings are matchings
    where no unmatched vertices of one of the sets have a common neighbour with a matched vertex.<br><br>

    Intuitively, think of one set as buyers looking to buy a house and the other set representing houses for sale.<br>
    Edges in this graph represent a buyer interested in a house.<br>
    If one buyer got a house but another buyer was also interested
    in this house and didn't buy a house himself he becomes jealous of the other buyer.<br><br>

    These kinds of matching help us find matchings in these scenarios and the example above is one real-life application for the algorithm.
