    Here you see the graph, with the matching that was calculated drawn in <span style="color: red">red</span>.<br>
    In this case we got a matching of size <b>{{ matching_size }}</b>

<h3>
    General explanation:
</h3>
<h4>
    Envy free bipartite matchings are matchings
    where no unmatched vertices of one of the sets have a common neighbour with a matched vertex.<br><br>

    Intuitively, think of one set as buyers looking to buy a house and the other set representing houses for sale.<br>
    Edges in this graph represent a buyer interested in a house.<br>
    If one buyer got a house but another buyer was also interested
    in this house and didn't buy a house himself he becomes jealous of the other buyer.<br><br>

    These kinds of matching help us find matchings in these scenarios and the example above is one real-life application for the algorithm.
