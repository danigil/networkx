# Ways to increase program runtime
![plot](plot.png "plot of time comparisons")

Time measurements comparisons between the same code once running with regular python interpreter in a virtual environment and once compiled using cython  
In order to run:  
compile using cythonize inside the cython folder and then copy the resulting files one directory up, and then run python compare.py  
Inside the program more values of sizes can be added to the array, although on my pc it seems to take too long
